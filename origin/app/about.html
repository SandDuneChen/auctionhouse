	  <h1>About AuctionHouse</h1>
	  <p>
            AuctionHouse is a decentralized app built on Ethereum to
            facilitate the auction of on-chain goods. Here are some
            frequently asked questions about AuctionHouse.

            <div class="faqquestion">
              <p>
                What can I auction on AuctionHouse?

            <div class="faqanswer">
              <p>
                Any on-chain asset that conforms to
                the <a href="https://github.com/dob/auctionhouse/blob/master/contracts/Asset.sol">Asset
                contract interface</a> can be auctioned. Some examples
                of things that could be auctioned are virtual goods,
                domain names, tokens that represent a role in an on
                chain economy, or tokens that represent real world
                assets like tickets.

                Is AuctionHouse production ready and running on the
                Ethereum mainnet?

              <p>
                No. AuctionHouse is in alpha and is running on the
                Ethereum Ropsten Testnet. We will deploy it on the
                mainnet after a round of testing and security scrutiny
                from the community. There are also a number of
                semantic points that we'd like feedback on including
                how to best standardize representation of on chain non
                fungible assets in a secure way, so there may be
                changes before deploying to the mainnet.

              <p>
                I keep seeing errors about not having a connection to
                the network. What's this about?

                As a decentralized app running on Ethereum, every user
                will need to be able to connect to an Ethereum node in
                order to interact with AuctionHouse. The easiest way
                to do this is to
                install <a href="http://metamask.io">MetaMask</a>
                which is a browser extension that will connect you to
                Ethereum. You can also run your own Ethereum node
                locally. Remember that the contract is not live on the
                Mainnet yet, so point your Metamask or Node to the
                Ropsten Testnet to try out AuctionHouse.

          <div class="faq">
            <div class="faqquestion">
              <p>
                When my auction ends, or when I get outbid, why do I
                have to "withdraw" my funds?
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="faqanswer">
              <p>
                For security purposes, it is recommend that Dapps use
                the withdraw pattern to let people remove their funds
                from contracts. This prevents a class of attacks where
                you should receive funds, but the attacker prevents it
                via stack limits. Instead, we will always show you
                your withdraw balance, and let you hit the withdraw
                button to receive these funds as long as your balance
                is greater than zero.

              <p>
                When I go to create an auction, why do I have to
                register a name?

                Since AuctionHouse is in alpha, and there aren't a lot
                of auctionable non-fungible goods on the blockchain
                yet, we wanted to make it easy for people to own an
                asset that they can auction. For demo purposes we
                created a simple contract called SampleName, and the
                "register a name" section on the create auction page
                is just an interface to register a fake domain name,
                so that you can create an auction with it. This step
                is optional, and if you were to deploy a contract that
                conformed to the Asset interface, then you could
                auction off a record from that contract.

                AuctionHouse was built
                by <a href="http://twitter.com/petkanics">Doug
                Petkanics</a>
                and <a href="http://twitter.com/ericxtang">Eric
                Tang</a>. We built it in order to get experience
                building an end-to-end Dapp complete with protocol
                layer, UI, and decentralized deployment. It's a work
                in progress, and we'd love to hear any feedback or bug
                reports through twitter or email, or
                on <a href="https://github.com/dob/auctionhouse/issues">github
                issues</a>.
